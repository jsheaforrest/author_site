        <h1>About Us</h1>
        
        <p>Hello! We're The Cambrian Crew, a plural system of about twelve members, depending on who you count. A plural system
            is a group of people, minds, and/or independent entities who share one body. We write fantasy and science fiction stories, often featuring themes of identity,
            self-discovery, and adventure. Our goal is to create immersive worlds and compelling characters that resonate with readers, 
            and also put more plural characters into the world. We especially want to do so without stigmatizing stereotypes like the "evil alter" or the idea that a system 
            must combine into one person in order to be "whole" and right.
        <br><br>J. Shea Forrest is the pen name we use for fiction, while we use our system name for nonfiction.
        <br><br>This site is designed with our three favorite colors: purple, green, and rainbow!
        </p></p>
        
        <h2>Our Writing Journey</h2>
        <p>We've been writing for the greater part of three decades, but have only recently gotten serious about it.
            A lot of our systemmates originated directly from the stories we wrote as a kid and young adult. Some of them
            see themselves as being literally those characters to varying degrees, so writing about their world and them as characters
            comes with additional challenges. While it does make it quite easy to write a fictionalized version of what they see
            as having actually happened to them, we also have to be careful about respecting everyone's boundaries and comfort levels.
            It's a balancing act, but one we are committed to navigating thoughtfully.
            <br><br>We also stream our writing process on Twitch every Saturday from 10:30am to 12pm CST, on Twitch <a href="www.twitch.tv/elecambria">here.</a> 
        </p>
        
        <h2>When We're Not Writing</h2>
        <p>We are voracious readers, preferring science fiction and fantasy, but several of us are also fascinated by psychology and the natural world.
            We enjoy gaming, especially cozy games like Stardew Valley and Fantasy Life. Many of us are also passionate about advocacy for plural systems
            and mental health awareness.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <p>We also are design enthusiasts who love making book covers and websites. We're also learning game design, which is a wonderful challenge!</p>
