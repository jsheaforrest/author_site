            <p><em>Mild spoilers for chapters 9 and 10. Canonically takes place two weeks prior to 9 and 10.</em></p>

            <h2>View One</h2>
            <p>Ele Cambria, the goddess whose name means Lady Wisdom, stood at Lin’s right shoulder, watching the camp alongside her Keeper. Well. Keeper in training. She still had some lessons to learn. Case in point: this. 
<br><br>
<i>They’re right there, I can see into the stable!</i> Lin argued, yelling in her mind, with the mental image of her stamping her feet. Of course she crouched still as stone now outwardly, so as to keep hidden. <i>Why are you stopping me from freeing them now? It’s wrong to cage them!</i>
<br><br>
<i>Because it’s not yet the right time, Little Grace.</i>
<br><br>
<i>So you’ve been telling me for three weeks! The whole time they’ve been building this camp!</i>
<br><br>
The Lady lay her hand on Lin’s shoulder. <i>Because there will be more to save later.</i>
<br><br>
<i>So? We can just save them later then!</i>
<br><br>
<i>Think, Little Grace. If we free dragons now, what will the military stationed here do in response?</i>
<br><br>
<i>They’re stupid. They won’t do anything strong enough to stop us. To stop me. </i>
<br><br>
<i>But they will make it more difficult. And our mission here is much higher than saving just a few dragons.</i>
<br><br>
Inwardly, Lin sighed. <i>A mission you still won’t tell me about. That’s not fair, you know. I do all this for you, at your order, and yet you won’t tell me what it’s all for?</i>
<br><br>
The Lady stayed silent. Lin was right. It wasn’t fair. But fairness didn’t change the world in the way it needed to be changed. And it didn’t change the people you loved in the ways that would make them able to change the world around them. 
<br><br>
But instead of voicing those thoughts, The Lady merely squeezed Lin’s shoulder. <i>We’ve gotten the intel we need for now.</i>
<br><br>
<i>We still don’t know where they’re keeping the air dragons,</i> Lin thought towards the Goddess.
<br><br>
<i>It’s time to go. </i>
<br><br>
Lin sighed, crawled backwards out of the brush cover, and on feet as silent as a soft breeze in autumn-leafed trees, ran back to the deep woods, where her friend Luck was waiting. 
<br><br>
The Lady watched her the whole way, pondering whether it would truly make a difference if she just told the girl her true aim. 
<br><br>
<i>I’d just get sassed at more,</i> the Lady concluded. <i>And it might interfere with her growth if she knows just how heavy the stakes really are. </i>
<br><br>
The Lady remembered something Lin had told her on a scouting mission last week. <i>If we can save them and don’t? Every moment we could have saved them, their suffering is on your hands. </i>
<br><br>
The Lady looked down at her hands, as soft brown as the inside bark of a Camberwood tree. <i>These hands are strong enough. Will yours be, Little Grace?</i>
</p>

            <h2>View Two</h2>
            <p>Lin, Keeper of the goddess Lady Wisdom — well, Keeper in training, technically, but that really made no difference as she could see and hear the goddess practically all day every day if she wanted to and most Keepers couldn’t do it but twice or thrice in a lifetime — crouched in a thick hedgebush with branches that poked her in myriad uncomfortable ways. But she tried to pay it no attention. Her focus was on what she could see past the bush: the fire dragon stables. Thick, ugly stone in large blocks, transported down the river from the capitol. Five fire dragons, chained to the floor, control collars tight around their throats. The sight made Lin feel sick to her stomach.
<br><br>
<i>Perfect, the guards are barely paying attention. We could free them now!</i>
<br><br>
The goddess shook her head.<i> Not yet.</i>
<br><br>
<i>They’re right there, I can see into the stable!</i> Lin yelled in her mind, internally stomping her feet. Of course she crouched still as stone now outwardly, so as to keep hidden. <i>Why are you stopping me from freeing them now? It’s wrong to cage them!</i> The goddess could be so infuriating. So calm, so patient... but letting injustice slide “until the time is right.” It wasn’t right. 
<br><br>
<i>Because it’s not yet the right time, Little Grace.</i> Again, letting injustice go unfixed. 
<br><br>
Lin considered arguing about the Lady’s favorite nickname for her. Grace was fine, but Little irked her. Though if you’ve been around for millennia like the goddess had, perhaps everyone was little in comparison. That kind of distance was wrong. Sometimes it wasn’t right to do the wise thing, the careful thing. Lin was close enough to hear the chains. She’d nearly been in them herself. That kind of closeness to the world’s injustice made her want — no, need — to end it now.
<br><br>
Lin rolled her eyes at the insistence on waiting. <i>So you’ve been telling me for three weeks! The whole time they’ve been building this camp!</i>
<br><br>
Lin felt the goddess’ invisible hand on her shoulder. <i>Because there will be more to save later.</i>
<br><br>
<i>So? We can just save them later then!</i>
<br><br>
<i>Think, Little Grace. If we free dragons now, what will the military stationed here do in response?</i>
<br><br>
It was a good point. They’d tighten security, maybe even move the dragons to somewhere more secure. But she argued anyway. <i>They’re stupid. They won’t do anything strong enough to stop us. To stop me.</i> 
<br><br>
<i>But they will make it more difficult. And our mission here is much higher than saving just a few dragons.</i>
<br><br>
Inwardly, Lin sighed. <i>A mission you still won’t tell me about. That’s not fair, you know. I do all this for you, at your order, and yet you won’t tell me what it’s all for?</i>
<br><br>
The goddess didn’t answer directly, but Lin felt her sadness. It made Lin angrier. What good was power, including the power to see and influence the future, if you didn’t do anything to make things better <i>now?</i>
<br><br>
The goddess squeezed Lin’s shoulder. She supposed it was supposed to feel encouraging. Lin felt stifled instead, held back for unknown reasons. 
<br><br>
<i>We’ve gotten the intel we need for now, the goddess said.
<br><br>
<i>We still don’t know where they’re keeping the air dragons,</i>
 Lin thought towards the Goddess.
<br><br>
<i>It’s time to go. </i>
<br><br>
Lin sighed, crawled backwards out of the brush cover, and on feet as silent as a soft breeze in autumn-leafed trees, ran back to the deep woods, where her friend Luck was waiting. This work had better pay off soon or, goddess’s favor or no, she was going to save those poor souls.
