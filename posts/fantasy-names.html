            <h1>On Fantasy Names</h1>
            <p class="blog-date">December 9, 2025</p>
            
            <p><br><br>One of the joys of writing secondary world fantasy is naming everything: characters, places, and the occasional bit of fictional language for flavor. (Maybe, in our case, a lot of the latter, especially in our early drafts!) But it's also one of the intimidating part: how do you make names that feel authentic without spending years creating a whole language?

<br><br>Here's the thing: You don't need a full conlang (constructed language) to have consistent naming. What you need is a system of naming.
<br><br><h3>Two Approaches to Fantasy Names</h3>
<br>When we started developing Era's End, we played with two different types of naming. Some names need to carry meaning, while others just need to sound right.
<br><br>Meaningful names translate to actual concepts. In our secluded village, everyone has phrase-names that tie into the story's themes. Our protagonist is named "All Good Things Must Have An Ending", or Ending for short. His name directly connects to one of our core themes: all endings are also new beginnings, and nothing lasts forever, for good or for ill.
<br><br>Euphonic names exist purely for how they sound. Take Temaera, a deserter from the Ghir'ar military. Her name doesn't translate to anything specific: it just sounds like it belongs in this world.
<br><br>Both are valid. Both are necessary. The key is knowing which approach fits each character and situation.
<br><br><h3>Building Your Naming System (Without the Linguistics Degree)</h3>
<br>We've done extensive worldbuilding and conlanging for the world of the Resonance stories, but you don't need to do what we did. You just need the building blocks.
<br><br>Focus on these three elements:
<br><br><strong>1. Your sound palette.</strong> What sounds exist in your language? We use a letter structure similar to English but with fewer consonant clusters (so things like "tr", "cl", "sn" combinations are extremely rare). This immediately gives our names a distinct feel.
<br><br><strong>2. Consistent phoneme patterns.</strong> A phoneme is a distinct unit of sound. How do sounds combine? In Zeranhan (our primary language), we indicate long vowels by putting an "a" before them. So in "Temaera," the middle "e" is pronounced long. Once you establish a pattern like this, stick to it.
<br><br><strong>3. One special character rule (maximum).</strong> We use apostrophes sparingly to indicate glottal stops or breathy sounds, like in "Ghir'ar" (the country name). But here's the important part: don't overuse special characters. They don't have associated sounds in English, so too many make names unpronounceable and annoying to readers.
<br><br><h3>The Balancing Act: Translation vs. Transliteration</h3>
<br>Here's where it gets interesting. We walk a line between three approaches:
<br><br>Transliterating (direct letter-for-letter conversion from Zeranhan to English)
<br><br>Translating the sound (using English letters that capture how it would sound)
<br><br>Translating the meaning (converting the concept into English)
<br><br>Ending's village uses meaning-translation. The country name Ghir'ar uses sound-translation - technically, in proper transliteration, it should be G'ir'ar, but we dropped the first apostrophe because there's no pronounced glottal stop, just a breathy "h" sound.And of course, because of the one special character rule.
<br><br>Why does this matter? Because your readers don't speak your fictional language. You're always choosing which details to keep and which to adapt for readability.
<br><br><h3>The Practical Takeaway</h3>
<br>Start small. Pick your sound palette and one or two phoneme patterns. Create a handful of names and see if they feel like they belong together. Adjust until they do.
<br><br>You can always expand your system as you write. We certainly have. But the foundation of those basic sounds and patterns will carry you through your entire book and keep your world feeling cohesive.
<br><br>And remember: some names carry meaning, some just sound right, and both have their place in your story.
<br><br>Happy naming!
