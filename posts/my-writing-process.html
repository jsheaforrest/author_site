            <h1>Our Writing Process</h1>
            <p class="blog-date">November 25, 2025</p>
            
            <p><br><br>We are not a kitchen tap. 

<br><br>It’s obvious, I know: we’re people in a human suit. 

<br><br>But when it comes to writing, we cannot sit down and simply turn on the tap and water/words flow out of us. We are an old-fashioned water pump, and we have to be primed first. 

<br><br>When we first started writing as a teenager, we quickly figured this out and started doing super messy pre-writing - all by hand, in spiral bound journals, as our access to a computer was quite limited back in the late 90s/early 2000s. 

<br><br>We wrote about a total of ten handwritten pages every few days (front side only, as we were annoyed by the sight of pen ink on the other side of the page.) Which sounds like a lot, until you consider that the first three to four pages were us figuring things out first: a wild mishmash of writing out our anxieties, whatever junk in our brain was stopping us from being able to focus, worldbuilding notes, goals to accomplish in the upcoming scene or two, what foreshadowing we were going to try to layer in, what plot beats we wanted to hit, character arc bits. And then we’d start the actual prose. 

<br><br>Also we have quite large handwriting so the resulting six or seven pages would equate to somewhere around 1000-2000 words. Plus we’d edit a bit as we went, scratching out lines and paragraphs and writing new pieces that we’d circle or bracket around and draw arrows to where it belonged. Overall a very tactilely satisfying process that our eventual switch to all digital has left us missing a fair bit. 

<br><br>Our mom writes children’s books, particularly picture books and early readers. We write science fiction and fantasy primarily for young and new adults. We have very different processes. Which she didn’t quite understand when we were new to writing fiction. 

<br><br>One day she picked up one of our writing notebooks and flipped through it in front of us (entirely without our permission.) She saw all the pre-writing and said something to the effect of, “No one is going to want to read this garbage.”

<br><br>That wasn’t the point of it. The point was to prime the pump and work through problems and aspects that we needed to be clear on before actually writing the prose part. Something that wouldn’t be needed in a 32 page picture book with a sentence or two on each page but absolutely necessary in secondary world fiction.  

<br><br>Still, it really stung, and stuck with us a long time. We wrote more after that, but very scattershot, and piecemeal, bits here and there on a dozen different story ideas. And we tried to limit our prewriting to as minimal as possible - which led to more writer’s block than we could overcome. 

<br><br>Three things really kicked our writing back into gear: 

<br><br>Writing sessions with our younger brother. He’s a great motivator, and we’re more storytellers than authors - so having him read what we wrote immediately after we wrote it is an intense highlight. And it really helped to talk out the story a bit before sitting down to write it. 

<br><br>And the second thing was something we hated for so long: Actually sitting down and putting an outline together. Scene by scene, bit by bit, chapter by chapter. Funny how much easier it is to write when we have a clear destination in mind for each bit. We rework our outlines semi-frequently, adding to it, moving things around a little. Lots and lots of adding as we go, as plot threads reveal themselves through the writing, as themes develop and show different ways of exploring that theme, as potential complications become evident, plot twists that show up unexpectedly, etc.

<br><br>And the third was actually doing pre-writing again like we used to. Sitting down and typing out what we want to accomplish, talking ourselves through character development and story beats, figuring out worldbuilding and how we want to illustrate that worldbuilding through each scene. And also doing a bit of journaling, working our way through our own anxieties and concerns and day to day detritus standing in the way between us and focused attention on writing. 

<br><br>Of all of those, I think the last one really had the biggest impact. It’s not just getting those things down on paper that matters. It’s getting the pump primed, so we ease into writing instead of trying to jump straight in on an empty page. 

<br><br>And it also gets us *excited* to write. It gets us looking forward to seeing those character beats, plot points, worldbuilding, in the actual prose. We love ideation, and those ideas are exciting. It becomes its own self-running motivation loop: the more we write about what we’re going to write about, the more we want to write, which gives us more ideas for more things we want to write. It’s like a vicious cycle but instead of being all terrible things, it’s all beautiful and, dare I say, magical: creating something out of nothing, one keystroke at a time. 

<br><br>And it’s addictive. The more we write, regularly and with people who are eager to see what we write next, the more we want to write. 

<br><br>This has real results. We’ve gone from writing a few thousand words a year on five or six different projects, to over thirty thousand this past year on a couple of projects, with significant progress on our current primary project, Era’s End. If we continue at the rate we’re going, with some changes to our schedule (like the writing stream we’re doing every weekend, and the weekly trips to a coffee shop on one of our days off where we write and vibe, and going to our local writing group two days a month) we can most likely finish writing Era’s End by the end of 2026. (Of course then it’ll need editing and revision, but we do a lot of that as we go.) 

<br><br>This is good momentum. And we’re keeping it going. 

<br><br>Here’s to a finished book next year!
